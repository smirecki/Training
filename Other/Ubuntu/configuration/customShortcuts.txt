Custom:
    - Volume down --    "amixer set Master 5%-" - "Super+A"
    - Volume up --      "amixer set Master 5%+" - "Super+Q"
    - mute --           "amixer set Master 0%" - "Super+S"
    - Clear desktop -   "Show Desktop" - super + d
    - screen lock --    "xflock4"
    - notes:
        - doesn't go down to 0%
            - UI volume bar shows 10-20% left and sounds still plays low when speakers are at full volume
        - try "amixer -D pulse sset Master 0%"
               - This works, but locks the volume at 0% and won't allow it to be adjusted afterward with custom keys - url - http://askubuntu.com/questions/454955/using-amixer-to-control-volume
    - page up / page down... what is the "custom script values"?

        - Possible solution
            - Clear preset key combo twice to clear new combo and old combo, then reenter new combo.
            - This worked!
    - Laptop 14.4
        - ctrl + a (select all) -- error with another key binding -- bad key binding with (super + a).
    - super + d show desktop is not working
        - Settings Editor -> Channel -> xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts
            - this works it should be working, but when you try to use it it fails.
