====================
problems -
	- Window manager keybindings don't work after reboot
		- https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xfwm4/+bug/1292290
        - Possible solution
            - Clear preset key combo twice to clear new combo and old combo, then reenter new combo.
            - This worked!
	- xflock - keyboard shortcut not working after OS update and not auto locking
		- Working again... auto update?
        - follow double delete trick to clear memory of key binding.
    - Laptop 14.4
        - ctrl + a (select all) -- error with another key binding
