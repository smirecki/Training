        - ERROR - "Gstreamer is missing plug-in"
        - UI color theme lost after OS update
        FIX:
            - Changing the bg/forground color improves this.        
        - Although this is a feature rich app, I would like a version of the UI that takes up less real estate.  Look for directions or tutorial on customizing this app.
- still not working
    - flux, redshift
    - Brightness Controller "free" with account creation
- Wallpaper aka "backdrops"
    - Look into better slide show settings

- Search for better fonts or to chose better fonts
