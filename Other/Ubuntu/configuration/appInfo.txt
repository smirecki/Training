    - Mocha
    - expressjs

- Mousepad Text Editor
    - default install
    - View -> color scheme -> classic (Use "Oblivion" if default bg is white, bg should be black after theme change)
        - Get another text-file be opened in new tab
            - Drag and drop another file into an open Mousepad file and it will me shown in a tab.
- Chromium
    - AB Plus
- FireFox Developer edition
    - Install
        - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/firefox-aurora
        - sudo apt-get update
        - sudo apt-get install firefox
    - no script
    - AB plus
    
- Midori
    - too broken to use
- Git
    - via Github
- Python - (v.3.4) Python Interpreter included
- Sublime Text 2, jshint(linting for Sublime)
    - must install Package Controller first
    - default color scheme Monokai
- VLC, codex (what codex?)
    - Tools -> preferences -> Playlist and Instances -> uncheck "allow only one instance"/"use only one instance when started from file manager"
		- Tools -> Pref. -> Audio -> output -> "ALSA audio ouput" (sound can stop when running on Linux)
- Audio 
    -Clementine
        - equalizer - techo preset or zero
        - Preferences -> Appearance
					- Colors - "Use a custom color set"
						- foreground/bg color ...
						- "No bg image"
        - Clementine has music streams, including SOMA FM station URLs built in.
        - ERROR - "Gstreamer is missing plug-in"
        - UI color theme lost after OS update
        FIX:
            - Changing the bg/forground color improves this.        
        - Although this is a feature rich app, I would like a version of the UI that takes up less real estate.  Look for directions or tutorial on customizing this app.

- Cheese - webcam software
- Calibre
    - software center
    - Use this program to manage a Kindle White-paper
    - the native OS fails and dies while accessing a Kindle, Calibre handles it perfectly.
- .cbr viewer with rar decompression "Document VIewer 3.10.3"
    - You must install unrar to allow any of these apps to open .cbr files, not just 7-zip (it won't work). 
        - sudo apt-get install unrar
    - Try "comix" or "mcomix"

- Inkscape - not needed
- Gimp - default installed
- Stopwatch
    - takes a lot of CPU resources for what it does 9-20%

					It will ask you a few questions.  Answer Yes for all of them.  Finally to get your CPU temperature type sensors in terminal.

- Kazam - Screencaster
    - frame rate 15 - default
        - 10 fps only makes a file 10% smaller
- Steam - not many Linux games available
- Furius ISO Mount - has worked well
    - The default iso mounting app fails on some ISOs, mounting files which fail when opened (Archive Manager, Brasero, Xfburn).
        - it can mount more than one file, but only launch one at a time.

[IDEs for TypeScript]

    - notes
        - built-in linting
        - You can Extend Visual Studio Code
        - TS is built-in to VS Code

    - Notes on - setting up transcoding build task
        - https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript

        - following this example to setup transcriping
            - http://michaelcrump.net/quick-tip-with-typescript-and-vscode/
            - sample project on Github to test Task Runner, basic few files
            - CMD-Shift-B (or CTRL-Shift-B for Linux) for opening Task Runner not working
                - Task Runner transpiling only (after .ts save)
            - looks to be working if...
                - you run this "tsc *.ts --watch" in the command line while in the working dir.
                    - I think this also needs these files: tasks.json, tsconfig.json
                    - If all that is done, then a new .js will be generate from the .ts and you can run a split screen on VS Code to see the .ts and .js
