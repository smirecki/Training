- Mame
    - not working...
    - must have roms that match emulation version
        - must have roms that have supporting files
    - Can you determine what version of Mame will support the files you have?
        - nope
    - Is there another app to audit roms or does Mame on Linux have a hidden function for this?
        - nope, but there use to be on another OS
        - It just has a Config Inputs function, nothing to audit roms.
        - You can run a Mame auditing app via Wine on Linux.
            - It will try to fix you roms, but it won't fix lost files or tell you which are missing.
                - how can you find out which files are missing?
    - can Mame handle NeoGeo roms on Linux - YES!!!
        - read/follow http://fantasyanime.com/emuhelp/mame#neogeo-games-need-neogeo-zip
            - must have neogeo.zip setup files to run neogeo roms
    - Can I install older versions of Mame?
        - Yes, but they are from source, only the Windows version has an installer and/or is only built for Windows.
        - http://docs.mamedev.org/initialsetup/compilingmame.html
    - Default version for Software Center is .152 from March 19 2014 - old!
    - Try newer Windows version through Wine...
        - App .17x runs, but roms are still not working for whatever reason.

    - ads get through on some sites
    - other sites are hostel to this app
    - they are letting some ads get past the filter

  	- Better than older ones I've used
    - has a nice whitelist feature
    - not perfect with images
  - Youtube Dark Skin
  - grammarly
  - Instapaper
    - free whole platform now.
  - ABP
    - not all ads are being blocked now.
        - are there better apps for this?
    - you can customize the filters, but must follow their API doc.
  - Vue.js Dev tools extension
    - this helps with programming Vue.js apps
  - Problems..
    - strange problems with some https sites
    - slow load times
        - Is this because of Ads loading
        - Is this from extensions
            - Ad Block Plus
            - Dark Reader
            - Instapaper
        - Check if load times and freezing will also happen with the same pages in Firefox. Some claim that Chrome in Ubuntu uses hardware graphics acceleration, which causes the freezing.
- Midori
    - was too broken to use
			- it must have been extensions or the no scripts option that killed it...
		- reinstalled seems to work fine without extensions
- FireFox - normal edition
- FireFox Developer edition - not currently using
    - Install

    - no script (updated for security hole)
        - serving a malware site... not safe???
    - AB plus
    - dark background app broken with new install update
    - Flash related content resource problems, run away process. Kill all flash content.
    - Flash enabling and disabling questionable results from sites
        - It could be some kind of cached settings interfering with changes
        - Some sites might have some content only in Flash and fail silently( or catastrophically)
        - Flash alternatives seem to work intermittently.
        - It seems to not run Flash, which is much less taxing on the cpu, but then it will cause the content to fail and it will then show an error about failing drivers.
    - odd errors with find command, highlighting not working or my UI customizations are causing it to fail.

        - Are there safe codex packs or updates for non-default installed codex?
            - ppa are used, so the packs are more of a Windows thing
        - Sound adjustments, can't make the sound mono.
        - dropped frames on large file playback despite system cpu less than 80%, Ram less than 20% and gpu/cpu fans not on high.

- VirtualBox
    - Ubuntu
    - RaspberryPi FOO
        - This won't work because VirtualBox is built for x86 and Pi is ARM.
        - The most popular OS is RASPBIAN, which is a Debian-based.
        - There isn't much reason to virtualize this, it's better to just develop on the correct hardware.
        - New prototype release today (12/23/2016), the Raspberry Pi Foundation has released an OS for x86, "powered by Raspbian"...
            - So this is an OS that was made from x86 Debian to run on Arm processors and then back to x86.  
            - Why do all of this?
                - So you can have the same OS to create and test with on both the Pi and x86 system.
                - It is also an alternative for older x86 systems.
        - Which Raspberry hardware can run Raspbian,  min req to run this OS?

            With Desktop    64 megabytes    512 megabytes   5 gigabytes 
    - What kind of specs do you need to run a VM for a full OS install (not just a CLI) of:
        - There will be minimums, but you will need to configure what resources each VM is allowed.  If you have a single chip with 4-12 cores or two chips with multi-cores (Xeno), you should have more than enough CPUs.  Other things to consider, fast enough chip(s) to run the app you need(as some will only use a single CPU, video rendering, gaming, Adobe apps),enough RAM for each VM, and a strong/fast/powerful enough graphics card to run your apps. 
        - Foo Linux
            - 700 MHz processor (about Intel Celeron or better)

            - VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution.
            - Either a CD/DVD drive or a USB port for the installer media.

            - https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Mac%20OS%20X%20build%20instructions

- Vagrant
    - ubuntu/trusty64
        - Note this will not have the tools for you to develop with, this is a general OS.  You will need to install or upgrade for your backend stack and tooling... php7, fooSQL, ect.
        - Updating the OS can take a long time and can hang/fail on restart.
            - the fresh install is going to need a lot of apps to run a LAMP stack, many of which you never knew you needed for things you know you need.
            - zip, git, PHP7, php5-curl, php-curl, php-xml, php7.0-mbstring, php libapache2-mod-php, php-mcrypt, sqlite, postgresql, nginx, mariadb, php-mycrypty, mailcatcher, 

            - Can you find a provisioning script for this LAMP stack for trusty64?

                - errors
                    - needs ruby > 2 and a lot of other apps... still having problems with this
                    - I've gotten Ruby > 2 installed, but it also needs (or I think it does) RVM.  I've installed all this and the builds have errors and the link file sharing between Host and VM was not working files any more.
                    - need rvm installed to do clean gem installs

- Clementine
    - equalizer - techo preset or zero

    - Clementine has music streams, including SOMA FM station URLs built in.
    - ERROR - "Gstreamer is missing plug-in"
    - UI color theme lost after OS update
    FIX:
        - Changing the bg/forground color improves this.        
    - Although this is a feature rich app, I would like a version of the UI that takes up less real estate.  Look for directions or tutorial on customizing this app.

- .cbr viewer with rar decompression "Document VIewer 3.10.3"
    - You must install unrar to allow any of these apps to open .cbr files, not just 7-zip (it won't work).

    - Try "Comix" or "mcomix"

- Gimp - default installed

    - takes a lot of CPU resources for what it does 9-20%
- PDF Reader 
    - Document Viewer, not great
    - Calibre opens Document Viewer to read PDFs

            - no info on web search for this problem
            - still a problem
    - failed PDF document
        - possible corrupt or altered
            - load in browser works
                - save to PDF yields a file that is still broken/altered
                - print and then save to PDF yields working version that is smaller
    - It likes to open on to a specific screen, even though it wasn't open/called/executed there.

                - you run this "tsc *.ts --watch" in the command line while in the working dir.
                    - I think this also needs these files: tasks.json, tsconfig.json
                    - If all that is done, then a new .js will be generate from the .ts and you can run a split screen on VS Code to see the .ts and .js

- Eclipse
    - I'm not sure if it's good for general web programming, but I've seen it used for JAVA programming and it was impressive with all of the auto addition and completions; adding all of the required methods for an interface contract... lots of error checking for complex code. 
    - it also looks complex or feature rich, you need to learn a new way of building programs.
