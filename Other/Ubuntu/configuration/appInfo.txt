- Chromium
  - AB Plus
  - dark reader - testing
  	- Better than older ones I've used
    - has a nice whitelist feature
    - not perfect with images
	- youtube - dark skin
  - Instapaper
- Midori
    - was too broken to use
			- it must have been extentions or the no scripts option that killed it...
		- reinstalled seems to work fine without extentions
- FireFox - normal edition
- FireFox Developer edition - not currently using
    - Install
        - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-daily/firefox-aurora
        - sudo apt-get update
        - sudo apt-get install firefox
    - no script (updated for security hole)
    - AB plus
    - dark background app broken with new install update
- Git
	- via Github website
	- Consider exploring Git GUI for exploring projects and better understanding errors and conflicts
- Python - (v.3.4) Python Interpreter included
- Sublime Text 2, jshint(linting for Sublime)
    - must install Package Controller first
    - default color scheme Monokai
- VLC, codex (what codex?)
    - Tools -> preferences -> Playlist and Instances -> uncheck "allow only one instance"/"use only one instance when started from file manager"
		- Tools -> Pref. -> Audio -> output -> "ALSA audio ouput" (sound can stop when running on Linux)
    - problem
        - Are there safe codex packs or updates for non-default installed codex?
- mpv media player
- Parole media player
- Clementine
    - equalizer - techo preset or zero
    - Preferences -> Appearance
		- Colors - "Use a custom color set"
			- foreground/bg color ...
			- "No bg image"
    - Clementine has music streams, including SOMA FM station URLs built in.
    - ERROR - "Gstreamer is missing plug-in"
    - UI color theme lost after OS update
    FIX:
        - Changing the bg/forground color improves this.        
    - Although this is a feature rich app, I would like a version of the UI that takes up less real estate.  Look for directions or tutorial on customizing this app.
- Cheese - webcam software
    - Haven't used it to send/upload video, don't know if this app is needed.
- Calibre
    - software center
    - Use this program to manage a Kindle White-paper
    - the native OS fails and dies while accessing a Kindle, Calibre handles it perfectly.
- .cbr viewer with rar decompression "Document VIewer 3.10.3"
    - You must install unrar to allow any of these apps to open .cbr files, not just 7-zip (it won't work). 
        - sudo apt-get install unrar
    - Try "Comix" or "mcomix"

- Gimp - default installed
- Stopwatch
    - takes a lot of CPU resources for what it does 9-20%
- PDF Reader 
    - Document Viewer, not great
    - Calibre opens Document Viewer to read PDFs

					After installation type the following in terminal

- Kazam - Screencaster
    - frame rate 15 - default
        - 10 fps only makes a file 10% smaller
- Steam - not many Linux games available
- Furius ISO Mount - has worked well
    - The default iso mounting app fails on some ISOs, mounting files which fail when opened (Archive Manager, Brasero, Xfburn).
        - it can mount more than one file, but only launch one at a time.

            - enter tag name (html, div, ul, li, a) and press tab to auto-complete
        - ... html within a TS file?
            - doesn't auto correct or warn if you are missing tags, maybe it will with a extension

    - Notes on - setting up transcoding build task
        - https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript

        - following this example to setup transcriping
            - http://michaelcrump.net/quick-tip-with-typescript-and-vscode/
            - sample project on Github to test Task Runner, basic few files
            - CMD-Shift-B (or CTRL-Shift-B for Linux) for opening Task Runner not working
                - Task Runner transpiling only (after .ts save)
            - looks to be working if...
                - you run this "tsc *.ts --watch" in the command line while in the working dir.
                    - I think this also needs these files: tasks.json, tsconfig.json
                    - If all that is done, then a new .js will be generate from the .ts and you can run a split screen on VS Code to see the .ts and .js

    - docker
        - vagrant and use docker images
    - LAMP
