                dashes around boxes
                    - This fix didn't work for me - "In ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css add the following line:
                        .undershoot.top, .undershoot.right, .undershoot.bottom, .undershoot.left { background-image: none; }"

    - You can change the icon for that app.
        - type the name of the one you want
        - right click it, select edit
        - left click the icon for "Icon"
        - In the "Select an icon" screen, choose a different icon.
            - If the one you want isn't there, find an icon you want online and add it to 
                - /usr/share/icons/FooYourSelectedIconChoice/Source Files/apps  
                - .../FooYourSelectedIconChoice/48x48/apps

- Problem
    - new user added icon(s) are too large when asking to open a file in non-default program
        - solution... 
            - check if it needs a smaller version of that icon
            - check if it needs an svg version of the icon, not a png
            - looks to be related to the damaged theme/icons after os update.
    - OS theme still damaged after OS update.
        - no auto fix
	- Check if the theme can be repaired if missing parts or why old theme lost elements
    - Check that adding a theme only requires putting the theme pack in the proper folder
	- having a problem with adding a theme
