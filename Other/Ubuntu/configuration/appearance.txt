                notes: chunky menus
                dashes around boxes
                    - This fix didn't work for me - "In ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css add the following line:
                        .undershoot.top, .undershoot.right, .undershoot.bottom, .undershoot.left { background-image: none; }"
            - Elementary Dark
