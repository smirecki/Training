                    - This fix didn't work for me - "In ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css add the following line:
                        .undershoot.top, .undershoot.right, .undershoot.bottom, .undershoot.left { background-image: none; }"

Extra App or Icon tweaks =========

Application Finder - fixing wrong icons
    - Note: some themes will or icon pack will not use the correct icon for a fe of your apps.
    you might need to replace a wrong icon.
    - You can change the icon for that app.
        - type the name of the one you want
        - right click it, select edit
        - left click the icon for "Icon"
        - In the "Select an icon" screen, choose a different icon.
            - If the one you want isn't there, find an icon you want online and add it to 
                - /usr/share/icons/FooYourSelectedIconChoice/Source Files/apps  
                - .../FooYourSelectedIconChoice/48x48/apps
Clementine - 
    - Note: it is better to adjust your theme first before adjusting the in app theme, as the OS will over ride the in app settings.
    (If you set a dark theme for the OS, this app will also need to be adjusted to the values below)
    - Preferences - User Interface - Appearance
        - Colors
            - Use a custom color set 
                
                    Hue Sat Val Red Green   Blue
                fg  0   0   170 170 170     170
                bg  0   0    59  59  59      59

            - Background Image
                - No background image

Pointer dark -
    - I don't remember if this was auto set when I changed the theme or It did this on it's own.

Second display - mount vertically
    - xfec or ubuntu/xubuntu OS can and will allow you to adjust the monitor.
        - The trick - you need to unplug and replug the second monitor in while the OS is running to trigger the OS monitor settings menu.
        - The in OS handling of the monitor is easier/better, but simpler than the graphics card software.
    - NVIDIA X Server Settings
        - X Server Display Configuration
            - select second monitor
                - Orientation
                    - Rotate Right/Left
                        - Apply - ok - 
                            - Save to X Configuration File
                            ----- Note if you skip that last step, the setting will not be remembered on restart!

- Problem
    - desktop UI flashes basic before theme kicks in
    - This is still a problem with 16.0x LTS.
        - At start up it shows a missized spash screen.
        - It starts without the correct wallpaper.
        - It sometimes start by showing the super basic unthemed menus.
