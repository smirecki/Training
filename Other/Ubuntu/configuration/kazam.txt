Note for this app.


Errors:

- No sound is being recorded in Kazam using Ubuntu
	- Check settings, they might get reset on app updates

	- File-> Preferences-> Speakers-> 
			- Speakers: 'Monitor of Built-in Audio Analog Stereo...'* or other option???
			- Speakers: ... VOLUME Icon... -> click and adjust 'max'*
			- Microphone
			- Countdown splash

	- The above settings fixed this problem

- Studdering video on some capture...?
	- hardware bottleneck??
