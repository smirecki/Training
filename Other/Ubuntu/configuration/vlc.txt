SOLVED] No sound after pausing VLC

[http://xubuntugeek.blogspot.com/2013/01/solved-no-sound-after-pausing-vlc.html  ]
Updated: 08/09/13
Symptom
    - There's no sound coming out of the speakers after pausing and resuming in VLC.
Fix
    - There are two alternative ways of solving this problem.
Fix #1
    - Open a terminal window and run:
    - sudo apt-get install vlc-plugin-pulse -y
Fix #2  < This worked for me
    - Open VLC preferences -> audio
    - Select "Show All Settings".
    - Open Audio > Output Modules > ALSA
    - Select your audio output device. You may have to try different values. Hit save, close and reopen VLC to test if the current value is the right one.

========
UI
Down-graded to basic after OS update.  You can download skins.

- Default install has modern UI on 14.x

Fix - Try to uninstall/restart/reinstall to force UI fix.
	- restart...
	- Yes, this worked.

Slow Visuals
    - good movement and frame rate at loqw res, very bad with dropped frames at full

"Customize Your Hotkeys
All of these hotkeys are fully customizable. To customize your hotkeys, click Tools > Preferences in VLC. Select the Hotkeys icon in the Simple preferences view. You can also find these options under Interface > Hotkeys settings in the All preferences view. The All view has a few more options — for example, it lets you change the amount of seconds the “Jump ahead” and “Jump back” key combinations skip back or forward. Double-click a hotkey field to set a new hotkey.

You’ll find lots of options here, including a “Boss key” that isn’t set by default. Set your own boss key and you can make VLC automatically hide itself in the system tray with a single key press. “Boss keys” are so-named because you press them when your boss comes around to check on you so you can pretend you’re actually working.

There’s also an option to control what the mouse wheel does — if the default volume control option doesn’t work for you, you can have the mouse wheel skip back or ahead in the current media file, or tell VLC to ignore the mouse wheel if you just find yourself bumping it accidentally."

"Set Global Hotkeys
All the hotkeys here only work while the VLC window is in focus. However, VLC also has the ability to create “global hotkeys” that work no matter what program you have visible. These are most useful if you’re using VLC as a background music or audio player — you can set Play/Pause, Next Track, and Previous Track keys to control VLC’s playback while using other applications. But any of VLC’s shortcut key actions can become global hotkeys.

Double-click the Global hotkey field to the right of any hotkey action to set a new global hotkey. If your keyboard has media keys for actions like Play/Pause, they make great global hotkeys."

"These aren’t all of VLC’s hotkeys. You’ll find a complete list in its preferences pane, and you can see hotkeys associated with many of the actions just by opening VLC’s Media, Tools, or View menus. Whatever you want to do with VLC, you can probably do it with a keyboard shortcut."
