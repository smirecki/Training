    - Appearance
        - File Manager

            - Missing icons
                - txt, mkv, epub, zip, opf, img, fooMadeUpName...
		- fixed by changing Icon/themes, but this is a work-around not a fix.

            - File System Icon different and low quality when enlarged
                - fixed with different icon pack
