Problems with new install from 14.04 LTS to 15.10 -
    
    - Appearance
        - File Manager
						- Missing drive eject icon
            - Missing icons
                - txt, mkv, epub, zip, opf, img, fooMadeUpName...
		- fixed by changing Icon/themes, but this is a work-around not a fix.
        - Desktop
            - File System Icon different and low quality when enlarged
    - Open with settings were changed
        - notepad instead of mousepad
		- changes have been resolved with autoupdates
	- still a problem!!!
