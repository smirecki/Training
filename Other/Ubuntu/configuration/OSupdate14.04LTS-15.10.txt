	- Start-up screen now showing 15.04 version.


Problems with new install from 14.04 LTS to 15.04 -
    
    - Appearance
        - File Manager
	    - Missing drive eject icon
            - Missing icons
                - txt, mkv, epub, zip, opf, img, fooMadeUpName...
		- Fixed by changing Icon/themes, but this is a work-around not a fix.
        - Desktop
            - File System Icon different and low quality when enlarged
                - fixed with different icon pack
    - Open with settings were changed
        - notepad instead of mousepad
		- changes have been resolved with auto updates
	- Still a problem!!!

Newer update 15.10, Wily Werewolf
    - Showing basic black start
    - Laptop showing blue at start v14-LTS
	- No fixed problems
    
    - Problems
        - settings lost in terminal
            - colors
            - commands, ls
- Nvidia driver errors
	- x-server shutdown, gcc same version

- new user added icon(s) are too large when asking to open a file in non-default program
    - solution... 
        - check if it needs a smaller version of that icon
        - check if it needs an svg version of the icon, not a png
        - looks to be related to the damaged theme/icons after os update.
- OS theme still damaged after OS update.
    - no auto fix
- Check if the theme can be repaired if missing parts or why old theme lost elements
- Check that adding a theme only requires putting the theme pack in the proper folder
- having a problem with adding a theme
