    - Notes on - setting up transcoding build task
        - https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript

        - following this example to setup transcribing
            - http://michaelcrump.net/quick-tip-with-typescript-and-vscode/
            - sample project on Github to test Task Runner, basic few files
            - CMD-Shift-B (or CTRL-Shift-B for Linux) for opening Task Runner not working
                - Task Runner transpiling only (after .ts save)
            - looks to be working if...
                - you run this "tsc *.ts --watch" in the command line while in the working dir.
                    - I think this also needs these files: tasks.json, tsconfig.json
                    - If all that is done, then a new .js will be generate from the .ts and you can run a split screen on VS Code to see the .ts and .js
