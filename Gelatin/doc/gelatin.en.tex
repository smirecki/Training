\section{Overview}

\product is a combined lexer, parser, and output generator. It is a simple
language for converting text into a structured formats.

\section{Example}

Suppose you want to convert the following text file to XML:

\begin{lstlisting}
User
----
Name: John, Lastname: Doe
Office: 1st Ave
Birth date: 1978-01-01

User
----
Name: Jane, Lastname: Foo
Office: 2nd Ave
Birth date: 1970-01-01
\end{lstlisting}

The following Gelatin syntax does the job:

\begin{lstlisting}
# Define commonly used data types. This is optional, but
# makes your life a litte easier by allowing to reuse regular
# expressions in the grammar.
define nl /[\r\n]/
define ws /\s+/
define fieldname /\w+/
define value /[^\r\n,]/
define field_end /[\r\n,]/

grammar user:
    match nl:
        do.return()
    match ws:
        do.next()
    match fieldname ':' ws value field_end:
        out.add('$0', '$3')

# The grammar named "input" is the entry point for the converter.
grammar input:
    match 'User' nl '----':
        out.enter('user')
        user()
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
