NOAA API info
    **** CORRECTION NOAA - NCEI  ****
        - National Centers for Environmental Information - Nation Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration... this is not the same this as NOAA's (tides) REST API.  
    - https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2

    Note: NCDC CDO Web Services requires a token to access data!  I don't think I can use this method to make a simple REST call using Codepen without exposing the token.
