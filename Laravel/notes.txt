Installing Laravel [composer... Global-Locally, i.e. not a VM]
	# download installer

	# change dir where to install
		- cd /var/www/html/
	# download and installing
		- laravel new laravelnew
	# giving permission to the development install
		- chmod -R 777 laravelnew


Installing Laravel Homestead and all the packaged tools [i.e. the VM Homestead, in Ubuntu or FOO-buntu]
	- following Laravel Homestead instructions
		- https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead
			- Install VirtualBox via Software Center
				- no further action needed.
			- Install Vagrant
				- via Vagrant site, 64bit - Deb, click, local Software Center assisted install, accept, check "vagrant -v" via CLI ... all good
			- Install the Homestead Vagrant Box
				- "vagrant box add laravel/homestead"
					-  download take a few minutes
			- Download Homestead
				- get Homestead main project from Github
			- Making a place for your Homestead
				- They recommend creating a folder for all your Homestead files in you "home" directory /FooHome/Homestead
			- "Configuring Homestead"
				- edit the Homestead.yaml file
					- edit provider: virtualbox
					- edit folders ...
					- check sites
						- default site: http://homestead.app
				- edit your host file to match you Homestead.yaml
				-
			- Launch The Vagrant Box.............

				- errors....
					- I missed something or the instructions were not correct. Vagrant Box will not boot up.
						- 'vagrant up'... error... 
						- you must 'vagrant init' first... 'vagrant up'... error... 
						- try to configure and boot VirtualBox... error no OS... locked on dead VM... CTRL + 1234 something to escape... =/

						- go to Homestead dir... run 'vagrant up'... errors... run composer... updating... error
						- It looks to have bad configuration info, setup for a Window C:/ drive by default...
							- Checked Homestead.yaml file... doesn't have any C:/ locations... maybe the config is somewhere else???
								- wrong PATH in Homestead/homestead
								- edit Homestead/Vagrantfile  three PATHS were C:/
								- fix my typo error =/ and continue
							- started to load, but failed on ssh... again it was looking for a C:/ PATH
								- edit /Homestead/scripts/homestead.rb... again C:/ PATH
							- 'vagrant up'... check up to date... already provisioned... run 'vagrant provision'
							- run 'vagrant provision'... error...
							- 




						- sidenote... ~ has Homestead dir that is linked to home/steve/Homestead

				- vagrant init
				- vagrant up
				-




FAQ
	- Where are these files?
		- You can quickly search for a file with CTRL + p (in Sublime & VS Code)

		- Routes.php				app/Http/Requests/routes.php
		- Template foo.blade.php	resources/views/foo.blade.php
		- Controllers				app/Http/Controlers/FooControllerName.php
		- CSS style sheet			public/css/style.css
		- sass or less				resources/assets/sass/app.scss
		- config files				config/foo.php
		- models					/app/foo.php
		- .env 						/.env
		- images					public/images
		- DB migrations				database/migrations
		- token controller 			App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken
		
	- Where can I find help?
		- 'php artisan'
			- this will show you the help file
	- How do you serve the pages or start the server?
		- 'php artisan serve'
	- Tinker, allows you to make changes in your build via CLI like npm
		- 'php artisan tinker'
			- check data, add data
	
	- Elixir, what is it?
		- Predefined mixin to perform common tasks or an API for defining basic Gulp tasks for your Laravel application.
		- it needs npm to run Gulp and finish the build
		- "gulp --production" will run the sass and minify
		- "gulp watch" to update automatically 

	- Database setup
		- create new DB with the name you want
		- edit the .env with the name of your new DB, the correct login name/pw

Make(ing)
	- Controllers
		- php artisan make:controller FooControllerName
	- migrations
		- php artisan make:migration FooNameOfFile
Setting up the DB for sqlite
	- create folder and file
		- touch database/database.sqlite
	- change presets in .env from mysql to sqlite
	- change presents in config/database.php at line 29 & 51
		- 29 "'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'sqlite'),"
		- 51 "'database' => database_path('database.sqlite'),"

Create migration
	- fail... file access error
		- check .env
			- DB_CONNECTION=sqlite  // defaults to mysql... must be change to use sqlite
		- correct config/database.php
			- 'database' => database_path('database.sqlite') // no ENV data
			- original
				- 'database' => env('DB_DATABASE', database_path('database.sqlite')),
				- 'database' => database_path('database.sqlite'),

		- do not need to change sqlite dev default values for...
			- 	DB_DATABASE=homestead
				DB_USERNAME=homestead
				DB_PASSWORD=secret
		- might not need permissions changes
			- I made changes before correcting the other files




Create a Model...

Other common tasks...


DB - Create tables...
	- php artisan
		- (use query builder) 
			- DB::table('cards')->insert(['title' => 'My New Card', 'created_at' => new DateTime, 'updated_at' => new DateTime]);
		- error at 07 10:33 ---- typo error... will cause this
			- Illuminate\Database\QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000]': General error: 1 table cards has no column name update_at (SQL: insert into "cards" ("title", "created_at", "update_at") values (foo bar))'	

Routes
	- list in CLI
		- php artisan route:list
	- Create CRUD routes
		- this line should be in your routes.php file
		- "Route::resource('post', 'PostController');"

============
Random errors while installing or running:
	- give the correct permissions to PHP and or the directories so Laravel can create a new project in Foo directory /var/www/html/foobar

	- add "php5-sqlite" if sqlite "can't find driver", should be included in PHP install, but isn't with *Ubuntu
		- sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite

problems
	- Breaking changes from version Laravel 5.0 -5.2
		 - "token mismatch exception"
		 	- work around for dev env tut 
		 		- edit App\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken
		 			- add pages that you want to bypass check... all = '*' or some =' foo/bar/row/*'

migrations and rolling back, refresh, 
			- he covers this much later @ vid11 12:47


serve the project/site with this stack
	- "php artisan serve" within the root directory

php artisan tinker
	- use to create new "card" adding to DB
		- DB::table('cards')->insert(['title' => 'My New Card', 'created_at' => new DateTime, 'updated_at' => new DateTime]);
		- DB::table('cards')->insert(['title' => 'My Second New Card', 'created_at' => new DateTime, 'updated_at' => new DateTime]);
	- query
		- DB::table('cards')->get();
		- DB::table('cards')->where('title', 'My New Card')->first();
	- delete
		- DB::table('cards')->where('title', 'My New Cards')->delete();

	note: be careful not to tab or escape out of Tinker into the normal CLI, Tinker and CLI look very similar and none of the DB commands will work the same in the CLI.

php artisan make:model Card  //Eloquent

making relationships (wording)

=====
- use Faker for seeding a DB with dumb data
	- https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker
======
- laravel facades use aliases
	- foo::bar   is like foo:: bam/ram/jam/bar
======
Very common mistakes

	-- All of these errors are simple and dumb when you see what they are, but you will make these errors.

	- Normal misspelling
		- typing something that isn't a word.  This is easy to find with spell check on.
	- Plurality error
		- this one is huge and can take a lot of time to find, because it looks correct as it's a real word and the spell check doesn't catch it
	- Missing brackets or quotation marks
		- this is common when a section is retyped
	- Missing data in the database
		- Laravel will throw an error if your page asks for data that the database doesn't have.
	- Array bracketing
		- if you pass an array, it must be bracketed correctly.
	- Retrieving and passing correctly
		- This happened to the author many times, you need to call all the properties that you want to pass and pass them.
	- properly setup your .env file
		- Make sure your .env file is configured for the correct database type (sqlite, mysql, foo), you have a database by that name in your database, and it's the same name you are specifying in your .env file for the db.
	- Includes...
		- If you missed including the code to link the main content to the new page you've made, it will fail to show any page data, even the stuff that would come after the main includes. (@extends('layouts.foo')  @section('content'))
	- Mixing a scope resolution operator and the syntax for the Laravel facades
		- Using :: when you should have used a colon :
