installing Laravel

Random errors while installing or running:
	- give the correct permissions to PHP and or the directories so Laravel can create a new project in Foo directory /var/www/html/foobar

	- add "php5-sqlite" if sqlite "can't find driver", should be included in PHP install, but isn't with *Ubuntu
		- sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite
