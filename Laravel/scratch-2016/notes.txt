installing Laravel
	- https://laravel.com/docs/5.0
	- put Laravel in PATH

Random errors while installing or running:
	- give the correct permissions to PHP and or the directories so Laravel can create a new project in Foo directory /var/www/html/foobar

	- add "php5-sqlite" if sqlite "can't find driver", should be included in PHP install, but isn't with *Ubuntu
		- sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite

serve the project/site with this stack
	- "php artisan serve" within the root directory

php artisan tinker
	- use to create new "card" adding to DB
		- DB::table('cards')->insert(['title' => 'My New Card', 'created_at' => new DateTime, 'updated_at' => new DateTime]);
		- DB::table('cards')->insert(['title' => 'My Second New Card', 'created_at' => new DateTime, 'updated_at' => new DateTime]);
	- query
		- DB::table('cards')->get();
		- DB::table('cards')->where('title', 'My New Card')->first();
	- delete
		- DB::table('cards')->where('title', 'My New Cards')->delete();

	note: be careful not to tab or escape out of Tinker into the normal CLI, Tinker and CLI look very similar and none of the DB commands will work the same in the CLI.

php artisan make:model Card

Relationships in DB w/Eloguent.. errors.. missing "notes" or other errors, restart
