Laravel-Homestead-notes.txt
=============================



Installing Laravel Homestead and all the packaged tools [i.e. the VM Homestead, in Ubuntu or FOO-buntu]
	- following Laravel Homestead instructions
		- https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead
			- Install VirtualBox via Software Center
				- no further action needed.
			- Install Vagrant
				- via Vagrant site, 64bit - Deb, click, local Software Center assisted install, accept, check "vagrant -v" via CLI ... all good
			- Install the Homestead Vagrant Box
				- "vagrant box add laravel/homestead"
					-  download take a few minutes
			- Download Homestead
				- get Homestead main project from Github
			- Making a place for your Homestead
				- They recommend creating a folder for all your Homestead files in you "home" directory /FooHome/Homestead
			- "Configuring Homestead"
				- edit the Homestead.yaml file
					- edit provider: virtualbox
					- edit folders ...
					- check sites
						- default site: http://homestead.app
				- edit your host file to match you Homestead.yaml
				-
			- Launch The Vagrant Box.............

				- to avoid the errors below check these files for misconfigured paths 'C:/ paths'
					- .homestead/Homestead.yaml
					- Homestead/Homestead/homestead
					- Homestead/Homestead/scripts/homestead.rd
						- "#Configure Public Key For SSH Access"
					- ... maybe more
					- you might need to close the CLI terminal and open a new one for changes to go into effect or so a help page told me.
					

				- errors....
					- I missed something or the instructions were not correct. Vagrant Box will not boot up.
						- 'vagrant up'... error... 
						- you must 'vagrant init' first... 'vagrant up'... error... 
						- try to configure and boot VirtualBox... error no OS... locked on dead VM... CTRL + 1234 something to escape... =/

						- go to Homestead dir... run 'vagrant up'... errors... run composer... updating... error
						- It looks to have bad configuration info, setup for a Window C:/ drive by default...
							- Checked Homestead.yaml file... doesn't have any C:/ locations... maybe the config is somewhere else???
								- wrong PATH in Homestead/homestead
								- edit Homestead/Vagrantfile  three PATHS were C:/
								- fix my typo error =/ and continue
							- started to load, but failed on ssh... again it was looking for a C:/ PATH
								- edit /Homestead/scripts/homestead.rb... again C:/ PATH
							- 'vagrant up'... check up to date... already provisioned... run 'vagrant provision'
							- run 'vagrant provision'... error...
						- checking VirtualBox.. homestead is running and can be turned off
							- CLI still has problems and can't ssh
							-  
						- 'vagrant ssh' from /Homestead/Homestead...
							- can ssh... works... =)

						- ssh
							- Address: 127.0.0.1:2222    username: vagrant
								- not connecting with this
							- The username and password for both databases is homestead / secret.
				- Working... the basic install is working
					- file share working.

					- there are a lot of other things that can be configured like other DBs if you want or need them.

						- sidenote... ~ has Homestead dir that is linked to home/steve/Homestead

				- vagrant init
				- vagrant up
				-
