Dev env 
  - tut uses c9.io
    - create work space
    - use php
    - install Laravel
      - If you are not using Cloud9
        - get link from Laravel.com  
        - "Via Composer Create-Project"
      - If you are using c9
        - search for install docs for Laravel on c9.io via shell
        - use the shell command in the c9 terminal, at bottom of screen or with window new terminal
        - check that "shopt -s dotglab" and "mv laravel/* ./" complete
        - if the install fails reread directions and retry the steps that failed to load, this is a c9 system problem you just have to deal with.
        - follow directions to change default directory that the files are served from
        - follow dir. load updates
        - run project and click link to check to see if the install was successful.
