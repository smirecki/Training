tasktracker app ideas-

CRUD...

- Create tasks (todo?)
	- This could be a todo app, in it's most basic form.
	- It could be for larger project also, for example: losing weight over months, building project, 

- Read tasks
	- It will need to display the task(s).

- Update tasks
	- It will need to update the task(s).

- Delete tasks
	- ... ect.

- Extras for later
	- graphs for progress tracking or future planning
	- alerts - email, sms, mobile app???
	- first built for one person with no sharing or social functions

==========================
- Follow along notes... some of this will be added to permanent notes

Creating a new project
	- new project via composer
		- composer create-project laravel/laravel myapp
		- note this will create a new folder/dir named myapp with Laravel project contents inside.
	- new project via Github
		- "If you prefer, you can alternatively download a copy of the Laravel repository from GitHub manually. Next run the composer install command in the root of your manually created project directory. This command will download and install the framework's dependencies."

Auth Scaffolding
	- php artisan make:auth

Setup DB for MySQL
	- create database in MySQL fooName
	- .env change
		- DB_DATABASE = fooName
		- DB_USERNAME = ...
		- DB_PASSWORD = ...
	- config/database.php
		- this file should be default configured correctly for MySQL

Migrate DB configurations to DB... ie. create the table in MySQL
	- php artisan migrate

Make User via webpage, check in phpAdmin if it was created correctly
	- looks good

Question...
	- Do I build out page views now or keep adding to the DB with tasks?

Add Tasks to DB
	- 'php artisan make:migration create_tasks_table --create=tasks'
	- add a 'name' string to task migration
	- Question
		- Do I want to add a state to a task (not started, in progress, finished) or should I save that for later?  Keep it simple, add it later.
	- php artisan migrate
	
	- Question if you have a system that has users, which you do, won't you need to know who's task is in column Foo row Bar?  Yes you will... Add a user column to tasks table.
	- add foreign key of User_id to tasks
		-   $table->integer('user_id')->unsigned()->index();
			...
            $table->foreign('user_id')->references('id')->on('users')->onDelete('cascade'); 
    - php artisan migrate:refresh
